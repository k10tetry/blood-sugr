## About üìñ
Blood Sugar is a mobile application for Android devices, developed using Kotlin ‚ù§Ô∏è, that facilitates the self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. It leverages a local Room Database to securely store blood sugar measurements in both millimoles per liter (mmol/L) and milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). The application incorporates a unit conversion feature for added flexibility and offers insightful data visualization by calculating and displaying average blood glucose values.
